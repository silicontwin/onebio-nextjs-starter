# Overview

This is a OneBio (https://oneb.io) starter project based on Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. The goal of this project is to display a OneBio member's thought stream on their own website so they can configure the style of their thought stream to match their existing design, etc.

To get started, clone this project and update your configuration as follows:

# Add your OneBio API Key

Add the following variables to your `.env` file. It should not be uploaded to version control, and will need to be added to the infrastructure provider you're deploying with (e.g., Vercel).

```
ONEBIO_API_KEY=your_api_key
ONEBIO_USERNAME=your_username (including the '@')
```
